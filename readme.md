#Javascript Frontend Project

This project was my first use of Javascript to build a frontend application. I followed a three step process to go from start to finish.

###HTML & CSS: Basic Structure

In this checkpoint, I created
the basic framework for Bloc Jams including the index page, as well as tags to organize content in what will eventually become a digital music player.

HTML & CSS: Styles
In checkpoint 7, I added CSS stylesheets to the application in order to add colors, fonts, and other style elements to the page.  

HTML & CSS: Responsiveness
In checkpoint 8, I incorporated the viewport meta tag in order to scale the page to fit on all devices such as tablets and desktop computers.  I also created a landing css file to style the landing page.  Breakpoints were added to style the main page depending on the width of the screen used to view the page.  

HTML & CSSL Collection View
In checkpoint 9, I created the collection page (and associated css file) to display available albums.  

HTML & CSS: Album View
In checkpoint 10, I created the album view (and associated album css file) so that users can learn more about the album they select.  The album page includes a cover image, information about the album, and an HTML table listing the songs of each album.  A max-width container was added for more responsive styling depending on the device used to view the page.  

DOM Scripting: Animation
In checkpoint 22, I incorporated CSS transitions as well as animations.  I also created a landing.js page.  

DOM Scripting: Events
In checkpoint 23, I incorporated animations through the use of DOM events.

DOM Scripting: Collection View
In checkpoint 24, created a template to add as many albums as necessary to the collection page using DOM scripting.  

DOM Scripting: Album View
In checkpoint 25, I replaced the static content in the album with dynamic script to pull information from album objects and display it in the album view.  

DOM Scripting: Play/Pause Part 1
Checkpoint 27: DOM Scripting: Play/Pause Part 2
In checkpoint 26 and 27, I used DOM scripting to both play and pause songs in the library.

HTML & CSS: Music Player
In checkpoint 28, I added a music player to control song playback.  The music player allows page users to play and pause songs, view playback progress, and adjust volume.  

jQuery: Landing Page
In checkpoint 29, I added the jQuery library to the index.html page and refracted the landing.js page.  

jQuery: Collection and Album Views
In checkpoint 30, I refactored the collection and album pages to incorporate jQuery.  

jQuery: Play/Pause
In checkpoint 31, I further refactored my album.js file to reduce redundant code.

jQuery: Next and Previous Buttons
In checkpoint 32, I added functionality to incorporate next and previous buttons to shift between songs in an album.  

jQuery: Buzz Library
In checkpoint 32, I used the Buzz music library to add songs to my Bloc Jams application to play.  I also added a volume function to adjust the sound of the music.
